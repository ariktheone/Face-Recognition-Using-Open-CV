# Face Recognition Project

## Introduction
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using Flask, OpenCV, and face_recognition library. It allows users to upload images for recognition and displays the result with the recognized name overlaid on the video feed.

## Technologies Used
- Flask
- OpenCV
- face_recognition library
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.

## Usage
1. Visit the homepage to see the live video feed with real-time face recognition.
2. Upload your own images for recognition by clicking on the "Upload Your Image" section and following the instructions.

## Features
- Real-time face recognition from webcam feed.
- Upload images for recognition.
- Display recognized name overlaid on the video feed.

## Example
```python
# Run the Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
# Performance Evaluation
The performance of the face recognition system can be evaluated based on accuracy and processing speed. Further optimizations and fine-tuning may be needed for specific use cases.

# Future Work
- Implement user authentication for secure access to the face recognition system.
- Enhance performance by optimizing face recognition algorithms.
- Add support for recognizing multiple faces simultaneously.
