## Introduction
Welcome to our cutting-edge Face Recognition Project! Leveraging Flask, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library, we've developed an innovative real-time face recognition system. Users can seamlessly upload images for recognition and witness instant results as the system overlays recognized names onto the live video feed.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Provides a lightweight and efficient web framework for hosting the face recognition system.
- **OpenCV**: Empowers the system with computer vision capabilities, enabling real-time video processing.
- **face_recognition library**: Utilizes state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms for accurate identification.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Enhances the user interface and interaction for a seamless experience.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to ensure access to the latest updates and features.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Effortlessly install dependencies using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
3. **Launch the Application**: Simply launch the Flask application with the command `python app.py`.

## Usage
1. **Explore the Homepage**: Dive into the homepage where the live video feed awaits, showcasing the system's prowess in real-time face recognition.
2. **Upload Custom Images for Training**: Engage further by uploading custom images for recognition and training the model. This feature allows users to contribute to the model's training process, improving accuracy over time.
